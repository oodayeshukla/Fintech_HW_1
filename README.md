## Overview and Business Activities

Eversana specializes in the commercialization and launch of drugs in the marketplace, providing a turn-key solution to transition a drug asset from the lab and clinical trials into the hands of doctors and patients. Many biotech and pharmaceutical manufacturers need to hire a marketing team, sales force, and an ad agency to commercialize their product. EVERSANA provides all these services as an integrated offering. The benefits of an integrated offering is an increase of sales over a five year period since EVERSANA provides detailed insights to target the right patient with the right therapy at the right time. 

From a financial aspect, the role that EVERSANA plays is to enable a Biotech or pharmaceutical company to contract out the commercialization activities to a thrid party.  EVERSANA in turn is able to provide the analytics and insights needed target the right patient and physician.  In some cases, EVERSANA is able to contractually guarantee a revenue/sales target over a five year window.   

EVERSANA is funded by two private equity firms.  To date approximately $500 million has been invested to build out the various divisions of EVERSANA.  

The unique solution that EVERSANA offers is an integrated data ecosystem combining medical claims, consumer, and hospital and doctor visit records.  An advanced machine learning platform is used to predict events in a patients' journey.  This includes, predicting a drug switch, the diagosis of a disease, and other common metrics such as adherence, compliance, and persistance.  

## Market Landscape
One dominant market segment that EVERSANA participates in, is in rare diseases.  There are 7000 rare diseases identified with approximately 30 million patients in the US who suffer from a rare disease.  The worldwide rare disease population is estimated to be 320 million.  It typically takes 7-9 years to properly diagnose a rare disease.  In addition, the direct and indirect costs of rares diseases in the US in 2019 is estimated to be $1 trillion.  

To address this market segment, EVERSANA has deployed a machine learning solution to discover the undiagnosed rare disease patient.  This machine learning solution processes large patient claims databases to discover patients who exhibit the pattern of a rare disease patient, but are not diagnosed, nor are they on a rare disease therapy.
